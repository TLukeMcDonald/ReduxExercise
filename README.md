Learning Redux fromn Linkedin Learning 

This is my first look at Redux. Before all of my apps have had state managed within React. This pushes the state into redux. 

Creating test script with javascript and holding them initially in the index.js file. Eventually want to refactor with a testing library.

Redux is a JavaScript library for managing client data in apps. You can use Redux together with React or with any other view library. Inspired by Flux, Redux attempts to make state mutations predictable by imposing certain restrictions on how and when updates can happen. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to understand and debug. This course helps you understand Redux and its role in dynamic JavaScript applications. Instructor Alex Banks demonstrates Redux by building the data layer for a small sample app, and integrating that data into existing React components. Along the way, you'll learn how to create and combine reducers, build middleware, make action creators, and put it all together to drive a component-based interface.
